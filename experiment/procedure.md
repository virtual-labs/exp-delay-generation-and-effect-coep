### Procedure

##### Simulator :
- step 1 : Select clock frequency.
- step 2 : Enter Total Delay(ms) between 1 mS to 1000 mS.
- step 3 : Enter ON Delay and OFF Delay in millisecond. The Addition of ON Delay and OFF Delay must be same as Total Delay.
- step 5 : Click on "SUBMIT" button.
- step 4 : Select Pin.
- step 5 : Select LED Configuration.
- step 6 : Click on "GENERATE CODE" button to generate code.
- step 7 : Click on "COMPILE" button to compile code.
- step 8 : Click on "EXECUTE" button to execute code and goto mimic.
- step 9 : If you want to download code click on "DOWNLOAD" button.
- step 10 : The MIMIC will open on left side of screen. 
- step 11 : Click on selected pin terminal(red circle) and click on anode terminal(red circle) for connection of the selected pin to anode. OR click on anode terminal(red circle) and click on selected pin terminal(red circle) for connect the anode to selected pin.
- step 12 : Click on cathode terminal(red circle) and click on resistor terminal(red circle) for connection of cathode to resister. OR click on resistor terminal(red circle) and click on cathode terminal(red circle) for connection of resister to cathode.
- step 13 : Click on "Check Connection" button.
- step 14 : If you see alert like "Wrong Connection. Please Try Again." click on "Reset Connection" button and follow step 11,12 and 13.
- step 15 : If you see alert like "Connection Established Successfully. Now Click on Run Button." Click on "Run" button.
- step 16 : Output LED is on. now observe the square wave graph.
- step 17 : Click on "REFRESH" button. to Re-executing the experiment.
